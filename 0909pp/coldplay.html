    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1996.[1][2] The four members – which include lead vocalist/pianist Chris Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion – were at University College London and came together from 1996 to 1998, during which time the band changed names from Pectoralz, to Starfish, then Coldplay.[3][4] Creative director and former manager Phil Harvey is often referred to as the fifth member by the band.[4] They recorded and released two EPs: Safety in 1998 and The Blue Room in 1999. The latter was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.</p>
